Additionally, sections 6.7 and 6.8 of RFC 2045 [RFC2045] provide encodings used in MIME. This keyword is derived from MIME's Content-Transfer-Encoding header, which was designed to map binary data into ASCII characters. It is not related to HTTP's Content-Encoding header, which is used to encode (e.g. compress or encrypt) the content of HTTP request and responses.\n\nAs &quot;base64&quot; is defined in both RFCs, the definition from RFC 4648 SHOULD be assumed unless the string is specifically intended for use in a MIME context. Note that all of these encodings result in strings consisting only of 7-bit ASCII characters. Therefore, this keyword has no meaning for strings containing characters outside of that range.\n\nIf this keyword is absent, but &quot;contentMediaType&quot; is present, this indicates that the encoding is the identity encoding, meaning that no transformation was needed in order to represent the content in a UTF-8 string.\n\nThe value of this property MUST be a string.<br/><br/>See <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#name-contentencoding\">JSON Schema Specification</a></div></body></html>"
